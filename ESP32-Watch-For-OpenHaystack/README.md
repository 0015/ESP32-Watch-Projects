It's able to track the ESP32 without GPS using OpenHaystack. Because it works so well, it may lead to privacy issues.

The ESP32-Watch for OpenHaystack is designed to be trackable by the user's choice. It includes minimal watch functionality and broadcasting over BLE for Apple's Find my network.

## Introduction

This project is based on the firmware for ESP32 from OpenHaystack(https://github.com/seemoo-lab/openhaystack)

## OpenHaystack

To discover your device through Apple's Fine my network, you must first run OpenHaystack on your Mac. For more information, please refer to the OpenHaystack Github.

## ESP-IDF Environment

First of all, the ESP-IDF development environment should be ready in advance.

## Hardware

For the ESP32-Watch, I used the ESP32-PICO-D4, but any ESP32 would work.
- Any ESP32 (not ESP32-S2)
- SPI interface Display or more
- 2 Buttons
- LiPo Battery

## Software

Libraries used in ESP32 Watch are as follows.
